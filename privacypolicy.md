## **What information is stored?**

Only message content is stored.

## Why it is stored?
We store only _**message content**_ for `-save` command, which is used to fetch deleted message from a guild channel (only if you're in the same channel).

## How it is stored?
We use the saga network database and store it in the bot's internal cache.

## Who can see my data?
No one can see it because it is stored in the bot's internal cache and Saga network.

## How can I delete my Data?
Since we are using a saga network database, it is almost impossible to "delete" it.
